This source code is distributed AS IS (without refactoring, code cleanup etc.) due to no official support from this moment.

If you still want to edit/compile/debug source code:

Delete Nottorus_Plugin.dll and Addon_CSP.dll in project then unpack SourceCode.rar to Assets\Nottorus, so path to source code will be Assets\Nottorus\Editor.
After this everything should work as usually, plugin will works from sources and not from dll.


Building dll:

Nottorus_Plugin.rar, Addon_CSP.rar and Nottorus_Debug.rar in ForBuildingDLL folder:
This is empty solutions only with a links to source files. Used only for building 3 dlls (Addon_CSP.dll, Nottorus_Debug.dll and Nottorus_Plugin.dll). Should/can be somewhere outside the project.
All links to sources files should be fixed (just do a text replace in .csproj file).
Also setup the build output directory.
Note: DO NOT delete all sources in projects to add them again. They should be added as links, not just added/copied.
UnityEngine dlls references can be found in unityengine install folder (ProgramFiles\UnityEngine\Editor\Data\Managed)

Nottorus_Plugin - actually the main plugin dll
Addon_CSP dll - for parsing script files to be converted into nodes then by nottorus plugin.
Nottorus_Debug - for debugging scripts (the types from this dll is used by scripts to handle behaviuor/values then send them to nottorus).
All this dll's should be configured as EditorOnly in project inspector to do not be included to build.

Have fun :)
